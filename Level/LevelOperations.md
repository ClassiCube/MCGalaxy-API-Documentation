### Summary

The `LevelOperations` class provides high level operations for manipulating levels (both loaded and unloaded)

General guidelines:
- Methods do **not check permissions** - these must be checked separately beforehand
- Most methods return a bool for whether the operation succeeded
- When an operation fails, the source player is automatically messaged the reason why
